bootsigned
==========

Signed boot for iPhone and iPad with support from the jailbreak community. 

This signed boot library requires ideviceactivate library.

## idevicerestore may be required to run the device as root, so the following can be done:

idevicerestore [-d] [-u] [-c] [-v] [-h] <input.ipsw>

	-v, 		enable incremental levels of verboseness  
	-d, 		enable communication debugging
 	-u, 		target specific device by its 40-digit device 	UUID
  -h, 		prints usage information
  -c, 		restore with a custom firmware
